# Introduction 
This is a project developed during project-based learning at TechFabric School over the course of a month and a half. Me and the front-end developer Roman Kremez worked on the front-end part. Our technology stack on the front end: TypeScript, React hooks, React-hook-forms, Redux Toolkit, RTK Query, MUI, styled-components.
